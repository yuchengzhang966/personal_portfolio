          I'm a developer who thrives on building and shipping projects from concept to completion. With a special interest in AI, I have hands-on experience building web scrapers, orchestrating complex processes with tools like n8n and LangChain, and developing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. My work, from data analysis pipelines to automated content creation, reflects my passion for creating practical, intelligent solutions.
